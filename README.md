This is the assignment for week 1. The task was to make next-word predictions using LSTM on a given dataset in which the user has to type in some prompt and number of words to be predicted after the prompt and it returns a complete
sentence (Prompt +  predicted words).
lstm_model.ipynb contains the main code for the LSTM model used for predictions. Please run the entire code. In the code, I have taken the input prompt to be "Jack Ginsburg was" and the number of next words to be predicted to be 10. It can be changed accordingly.
